## Challenge:

Topic: “Health and Wellness” 

With the COVID-19 pandemic highlighting the importance of good health, this track could focus on developing solutions related to improving healthcare accessibility and affordability, promoting healthy lifestyles, and preventing the spread of disease.


## GetMedClinical Solutions: 

As we are looking into the future, we come across many new unknown diseases. We’ve seen many cases of these disease being spread more concurrently. In order to create an environment that helps prevent the spread of diseases and allowing patients who may not have immediate access to healthcare, we have developed a website that allows our doctors to create forms that can help patients to enter their medical issues, problems, & information. This website then helps identify problems that need to be addressed immediately versus the one’s that can wait.
